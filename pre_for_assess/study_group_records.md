In a word, too nervous to speak natually.
- I can just understand about 70% of what attendees were saying, especially something away from coding.
- At the beginning my introducing transcript helped a bit(yes I did so...), but didn't well control speaking speed.
- Since I can't understand a part of their words, I distracted a little in the middle of the session.
- When it's my turn to explain my code, I panicked. I spoke too fast so I just roughly expressed my idea, messed up some details.

So it's not so good and not too bad. At least I spoke......and people could understand what I was saying. I'll just count this as a big progress for myself! However, comparing to practising alone, I got so many feedback this time, both on programming level and language speaking level. I have so much to practice on! Baby steps to giant stride!
