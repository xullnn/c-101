Congratulations Xullnn, you aced this assessment!

You have excellent problem solving ability and coding fluency, which you displayed during the interview. You also were able to explain your code and solution clearly and precisely, and I was very impressed with your accurate use of terminology during your explanations.

Your solutions to both problems were very clear and concise, and your problem solving approach was good. I liked that you took the time to plan out your approach before coding, though I would have liked to see you use some more detailed notes/ pseudocode, this might have avoided running into the edge case with the first problem where you needed to downcase the input. I liked that you ran your code regularly to check output, and that you tested ideas out in irb.

Overall this was an excellent performance and you are clearly ready to move forward. Well done, and enjoy the next course!
